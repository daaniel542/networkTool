# Elephant Network Tool

Internal network utility for Elephant Technologies LTD.

The app is a Flutter desktop tool with Ping, Traceroute, DNS lookup, password
generation, and encoding/hashing utilities. Native desktop builds are the
recommended distribution path because Ping and Traceroute require local operating
system networking capabilities that browser builds cannot provide.

## Development

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Run locally on your current platform:

```sh
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d linux
```

Only run the command for the OS you are currently using. Flutter does not
cross-compile desktop apps from one operating system to another.

## Release Builds

Build the native release on each target OS:

```sh
flutter build macos --release
flutter build windows --release
flutter build linux --release
```

Release outputs:

- macOS: `build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Elephant Network Tool.app`
- Windows: `build/windows/x64/runner/Release/`
- Linux: `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/`

For internal distribution, package each release folder as a zip, label it with
the app version and OS, and send the matching package to each IT member.

## Web Limitations

The Flutter Web target can still compile for browser-safe tools, but browsers
cannot send ICMP packets or TTL-limited probes. DNS lookup, password generation,
encoding, and hashing can run client-side on web. Ping and Traceroute need the
native desktop app or a backend probe service.
